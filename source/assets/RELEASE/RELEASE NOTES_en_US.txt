RELEASE NOTES — Lúmen
Version: 2025.12.2.0
Date: December 2, 2025
Author: Fernando Nillsson Cidade

Quick summary
- Pomodoro alarm system improved: selectable bell sound, preview, persistence, configurable repetition, and more robust playback.
- Fixes and improvements in alarm playback: repetition respects the audio file duration + configured interval; alarm sounds immediately at cycle end and repeats until the user closes the alert dialog.
- Sound configuration interface added to the Settings menu with duration preview and calculation of total time between repetitions.
- Improved reliability of sound playback (recreating QSoundEffect) to avoid failures after stop/preview.

Detailed changes
- Modified file: source/utils/SoundManager.py
  - New centralized sound manager (singleton) exposing: instance(), play(), play_repeating(), stop(), preview(), get_duration_for_path(), get_available_sounds(), get_alarm_interval(), set_alarm_interval().
  - WAV duration detection using Python's wave module (method _get_wav_duration_ms) to obtain a reliable duration in ms.
  - Repetition logic: play_repeating() plays the audio, computes the next trigger as (audio duration) + (configured interval) and schedules it with QTimer.
  - Clean recreation of QSoundEffect in _prepare_effect() before each playback to avoid the behavior where the sound only plays once.
  - Persistence of selected bell and interval in QSettings (keys: "pomodoro/sound_path" and "pomodoro/alarm_interval").
  - Improved preview and stop methods; default fallback duration (3000ms) when detection fails.

- Modified file: source/gui/gui_23_sound_config_dialog.py
  - New dialog "🔔 Configure Pomodoro Sound" with:
    - Combobox to select bell (list of WAVs in assets/sound).
    - ▶️ Play button for preview.
    - SpinBox to set the repetition interval (seconds) between repeats (0–60).
    - Display of selected file duration and total time until next repetition (duration + interval).
  - On save, stores bell and interval in QSettings via SoundManager.

- Modified file: source/gui/gui_03_setup_menubar.py
  - Added action "🔔 Sound..." in the "⚙️ Settings" menu to open the sound configuration dialog.
  - Updates modules after dialog confirmation (calls atualizar_modulos when available).

- Modified file: source/modules/tempo/tmp_02_PomodoroTimer.py
  - Integrated with SoundManager.instance() to play alarms when focus/rest periods end.
  - Method _executar_alerta shows a QMessageBox and starts the repeating alarm (play_repeating) before showing the dialog; connects dialog close to stop the alarm.
  - Fix so the sound plays immediately when the cycle ends and continues repeating until the alert dialog is manually closed.
  - Added logging and exception handling.

- Modified file: source/gui/gui_08_atualizar_menu.py
  - Ensures the "🔔 Sound..." label/action is updated when the language changes.

Impact and expected behavior
- When a focus or rest cycle ends:
  - The alert dialog (QMessageBox) appears immediately.
  - The alarm plays immediately and repeats until the user closes the dialog.
  - Repetition respects the audio file duration: the next play occurs only after (audio duration) + (user-configured interval).
- Selected bell and interval are persisted in local settings (QSettings).
- Preview allows listening to the bell without enabling repetition.

How to test (quick steps)
1. Open the application and go to ⚙️ Settings → 🔔 Sound...
2. Select a bell (WAV) and use ▶️ Play for preview.
3. Adjust "Interval between repetitions" (e.g., 5s) and check the label "Repetition every: X.XX seconds" (file duration + interval).
4. Save and run a short Pomodoro (or skip a cycle) until finalizar_ciclo fires.
5. Confirm that:
   - The sound plays immediately with the alert dialog.
   - The sound repeats after (WAV duration) + (configured interval).
   - Closing the alert dialog stops the sound immediately.
6. Repeat for rest cycle; test changing bell between cycles.

Technical notes
- Implementation uses PySide6.QtMultimedia.QSoundEffect for local playback (WAV-compatible). WAV duration is measured with Python's standard wave module (no external dependencies).
- Settings persisted via QSettings under namespace "Lumen"/"LumenApp".
- Recommended to have PySide6 with multimedia (FFmpeg) support in the environment.
- For non‑WAV files, duration detection falls back (3s). Full support for MP3/other formats may require QMediaPlayer or additional libraries.

Main files changed
- source/utils/SoundManager.py (new / modified)
- source/gui/gui_23_sound_config_dialog.py (new config dialog)
- source/gui/gui_03_setup_menubar.py (dialog integration in menu)
- source/modules/tempo/tmp_02_PomodoroTimer.py (alarm integration and control)
- source/gui/gui_08_atualizar_menu.py (menu translations)

Known issues
- Exact duration is only calculated for WAV files via wave; other formats may fall back. For full format support (MP3, OGG), consider using QMediaPlayer metadata or external libraries (pydub, mutagen).
- Very large WAV files may increase read cost; the routine is simple and synchronous.
- Translations: dialog strings and labels must be recompiled into .qm (pyside6-lrelease) after .ts changes to take effect.

RELEASE NOTES — Lúmen
Version: 2025.11.29.0
Date: November 29, 2025
Author: Fernando Nillsson Cidade

Quick summary
- Fix in the Accessible Reader (TTS) behavior: when clicking "⏸️ Pause" playback now remains paused and newly generated chunks are kept queued, preventing the reader from automatically advancing to the next chunk.

Detailed changes
- Modified file: source/modules/leitor/leitor_acessivel/lta_09_play_generated_audio.py
  - Pause behavior fixed:
    - Before: when the user paused playback, newly generated audio files (chunks) could start automatically, causing the reader to skip the pause.
    - Now: the _play_generated_audio function explicitly checks the player state (QMediaPlayer.PausedState) and the internal _is_paused flag. If the player is paused, new chunks do NOT start automatically — they are only added to the queue (_generated_queue) for later playback.
  - Additional protections:
    - Preservation of chunks during voice change: if _changing_voice is active, generated chunks are safely discarded (attempt to remove the file) and ignored.
    - Duplicate control: generated file paths are recorded in _generated_files to avoid duplicate reprocessing.
    - Playback state check: does not attempt to start new audio if already in PlayingState; respects PausedState.
  - Robustness and logging:
    - Expanded exception handling to avoid silent failures and ensure leitura_finalizada() is called when appropriate.
    - Log messages document errors when starting chunk playback and failures when cleaning up generated files.

Impact and expected behavior
- User pauses narration with the "⏸️ Pause" button: playback stops; newly generated chunks from the TTS mechanism are queued and do NOT start playing until the user manually resumes (▶️ Continue) or the player is in a state that allows automatic playback.
- Voice change during generation: chunks created during a voice change are safely discarded to avoid playback with the old voice.

How to test (quick steps)
1. Start Accessible Reader with a voice that uses chunked generation (Edge TTS or similar).
2. Start reading.
3. While playing, click "⏸️ Pause".
4. Confirm playback stops and that newly generated chunks (e.g., for long texts) do not start automatically.
5. Click "▶️ Continue" and confirm the queue is consumed normally and playback resumes.

Technical notes
- The fix focuses on _play_generated_audio and interacts with QMediaPlayer.playbackState() and the internal _is_paused flag.
- Compatibility with existing audio generation and temporary file cleanup flows is preserved.
