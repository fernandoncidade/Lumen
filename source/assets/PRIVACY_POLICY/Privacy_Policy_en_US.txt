Privacy Policy — Lúmen
Last updated: December 13, 2025
Version: 2025.12.13.0

Summary
This Policy describes how the application "Lúmen" handles, stores, and protects user data. The application is designed to operate locally and, by default, does not send telemetry or user data to external servers.

1. Scope and principles
- Local operation: all data generated or processed by the application remains on the user's device, unless the user explicitly exports/shares it.
- Minimization: only data necessary for the features (tasks, maps, settings, history) are processed.
- Transparency: the user has full control over creating, editing, exporting and deleting their data.

2. Data processed
2.1 User‑entered data
- Texts, notes, task titles, labels, and custom settings.
2.2 Files chosen by the user
- Files opened/selected for import or reading are accessed only upon user action.
- Exports (PDF/JSON) are written to the location chosen by the user.
2.3 Local technical data
- Configuration files, history and logs may be written locally (e.g., settings.json, history.json, temporary audio files, logs generated by utils/LogManager.py).

3. Storage location and retention
- Default persistence location: %LOCALAPPDATA%\TEA_TDAH_Dislexia
- The user may manually delete history, settings and log files. Data remain until the user removes them.

4. Telemetry, reports and diagnostics
- The application does not send telemetry automatically.
- If an option to send error reports or diagnostics is provided, it will be presented clearly and require the user's explicit consent before transmission.
- Operating system reports (e.g., Windows Error Reporting) are generated according to system settings and are not controlled by the developer.

5. Data sharing
- No automatic sharing. Any sending of data to third parties depends on explicit user action (for example: sending an exported PDF or JSON by email).
- Third‑party libraries used locally (for example PySide6) are not used by the application to transmit user data to external servers.

6. Security
- Data are under the user's control and protected by the device's operating system.
- The application implements basic measures (atomic file writes, error handling) to reduce the risk of data corruption, but does not replace backups. Regular backups of important files are recommended.
- No remote credential storage or authentication mechanisms are used by default.

7. Legal basis and rights (LGPD)
- Data processing occurs to perform the functionalities requested by the user (implicit consent for local use).
- Data subject rights: access, correction, deletion and portability. The user can export their data (PDF/JSON) and manually delete local files.

8. Third parties, libraries and licenses
- The application uses third‑party libraries for local functionality (e.g., PySide6 for UI). Those libraries remain subject to their own licenses.
- License texts and notices are included in assets/NOTICES and assets/EULA when present.

9. Retention and deletion
- Data remain until the user deletes them. For complete removal, delete the files in %LOCALAPPDATA%\TEA_TDAH_Dislexia.
- Logs and temporary files may be rotated or cleaned by internal features, if implemented; users will be informed when this applies.

10. Children
- The application is not directed to children under 13 years of age and does not intentionally collect data from minors.

11. Changes to this policy
- Updates to this Policy will be recorded with a new date and version. Significant changes may be communicated within the application when applicable.

12. Contact
- Data controller: Fernando Nillsson Cidade
- Privacy contact email: linceu_lighthouse@outlook.com
- For data deletion requests or questions about local processing, contact the email above.

Final note
Use Lúmen knowing that data remain under your local control. For any integration involving data transmission, the application will require explicit consent and clear instructions before proceeding.
