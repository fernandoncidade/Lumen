   - Supported export formats via the interface: PDF, JSON and text formats; exported files are saved to a location chosen by the user.
   - The Software does not send telemetry automatically. Any diagnostic collection or data transmission will occur only upon explicit user action and prior notice.

6. THIRD‑PARTY COMPONENTS
   - The Software uses third‑party libraries (for example, PySide6 and others listed in requirements.txt). Those components remain subject to their original licenses.
   - Third‑party license texts and notices accompany the distribution package (folders assets/EULA, assets/NOTICES and assets/PRIVACY_POLICY when applicable).

7. UPDATES AND SUPPORT
